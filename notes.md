## types

types of variables - int, float, list(), string, function?

return types, simple functions,

and routines?


* look back to where we are in the tutorial,
* ask some questions about the types, and 'name the variables in this function and where they are created'

*


re-iterate at the end


## Final lesson
* Re iterate types, return types

* lists and bools

### Bools
* and, or, not.
* write out truth tables
* ask to answer questions about:
    * return of True and False, True or False, not True and True, not True or False
* less than, equals etc.
    * 1 > 2, 2 > 1, not 3 == 5, 3*5 < 20, not 12 <= 12

* write a function that returns 0 if x >= 20, else x


### Lists
* a function that calculates the length of the list
* a function that finds the largest value in a list
* a function that finds the smallest value in a list
* a function that returns true if all values in the list are < 20

### TESTS
* How might we test these functions?
* write some tests for the length of a list
